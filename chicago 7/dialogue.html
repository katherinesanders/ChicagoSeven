    <h3>Abbie Hoffman states his place of residence and age</h3>
    <div>
        <p><mark><b>MR. WEINGLASS:</b></mark> Will you please identify yourself for the record?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> My name is Abbie. I am an orphan of America.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Your Honor, may the record show it is the defendant Hoffman who has taken the stand?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE COURT:</b></mark> Oh, yes. It may so indicate. . . .</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. WEINGLASS:</b></mark> Where do you reside?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I live in Woodstock Nation.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. WEINGLASS:</b></mark> Will you tell the Court and jury where it is?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> Yes. It is a nation of alienated young people. We carry it around with us as a state of 
            mind in the same way as the Sioux Indians carried the Sioux nation around with them. It is a nation 
            dedicated to cooperation versus competition, to the idea that people should have better means of 
            exchange than property or money, that there should be some other basis for human interaction. It 
            is a nation dedicated to--</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE COURT:</b></mark> Just where it is, that is all.</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> It is in my mind and in the minds of my brothers and sisters. It does not consist of 
            property or material but, rather, of ideas and certain values. We believe in a society--</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE COURT:</b></mark> No, we want the place of residence, if he has one, place of doing business, if you have a 
            business. Nothing about philosophy or India, sir. Just where you live, if you have a place to live. 
            Now you said Woodstock. In what state is Woodstock?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> It is in the state of mind, in the mind of myself and my brothers and sisters. It is a 
            conspiracy. Presently, the nation is held captive, in the penitentiaries of the institutions of a 
            decaying system.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. WEINGLASS:</b></mark> Can you tell the Court and jury your present age?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> My age is 33. 1 am a child of the 60s.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. WEINGLASS:</b></mark> When were you born?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> Psychologically, 1960.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Objection, if the Court please. I move to strike the answer.
        MR. WEINGLASS: What is the actual date of your birth?

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> November 30,1936.

        <p><mark><b>MR. WEINGLASS:</b></mark> Between the date of your birth, November 30, 1936, and May 1, 1960, what if anything occurred in your life?

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> Nothing. I believe it is called an American education.

        <p><mark><b>MR. SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Objection.

        <p><mark><b>THE COURT:</b></mark> I sustain the objection.

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> Huh.

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Bobby Seale's Testimony</h3>
    <div>
        <p><mark><b>KUNSTLER:</b></mark> Mr. Seale, I call your attention to August 27, 1968. Did there come a time when you went to the San Francisco International Airport?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> Tuesday. That Tuesday in August. It was a Tuesday, I think.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> Did you then board an airplane?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> Yes.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> Do you know the destination of that airplane?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> Chicago, Illinois.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> I will ask you now to look at the defense table and I want to ask you this question whether, prior to boarding that airplane, you had ever known Jerry Rubin.</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> No, I had not.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> David Dellinger?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I never seen him before in my life.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> Abbie Hoffman?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I never seen him before in my life before that.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> Lee Weiner?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I never seen him before in my life.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> Rennie Davis?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I never seen him before in my life.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> Tom Hayden?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I had heard of his name but I had never met him or seen him before in my life.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. KUNSTLER:</b></mark> John Froines?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I never seen him or heard of him before in my life.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Symbolicalic Urination</h3>
    <div>
        <p><mark><b>MR. SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Mr. Hoffman, the Guards and the troops were trying to keep the people from entering into the Pentagon for two days, isn't that right?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I assume that they were there to guard the Pentagon from rising in the air possibly. I mean, 
            who knows what they are there for? Were you there?
            You probably watched it on television and got a different impression of what was happening. That is one aspect 
            of myth-making---you can envisualize hoardes and hoardes of people when in reality that was not what happened.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Did you see some people urinate on the Pentagon?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> On the Pentagon itself?</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Or at the Pentagon?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> There were over 100,000 people. People have that biological habit, you know.</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Did you symbolically urinate on the Pentagon, Mr. Hoffman?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I symbolically urinate on the Pentagon?</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Yes.</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I didn't get that close. Pee on the walls of the Pentagon? You are getting 
            to be out of sight, actually. You think there is a law against it?</p>

        <p><mark><b>MR. SCHULTZ:</b></mark> Are you done, Mr. Hoffman?</p>

        <p><mark><b>THE WITNESS:</b></mark> I am done when you are.</p>
