    <h4>David Dellinger</h4>

            David Dellinger was the oldest of the Chicago 7. In court, he seemed more sophisticated 
            than the rest, wearing a suit and tie. He has an impressive education, attending Yale and 
            spending one year at Oxford on a scholarship, then returning to Yale for a graduate degree 
            later in life. During his time at the Ivy, Dellinger would frequently serve time in jail for 
            his refusal to sign up for the draft. Dellinger was an activist in all areas, supporting the 
            right to unionize in the 1930s and protesting for civil rights. He was an organizer of the 
            National Committee to End the War in Vietnam. Dellinger had negotiated three American prisoners 
            out of North Vietnam, and escorted them back to the United States with Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis.
            He was seen as an energetic and genuinely happy person by the people who met him.

        <h4>Rennie Davis</h4>
        <img src="rennie-davis-color.jpeg" alt="Rennie Davis" style="width:240px;" class="image1">
        <p>
            Rennie Davis was born in Michigan, and graduated from Oberlin College. He was a 
            member of the Students for a Democratic Society and the National Mobilization Committee 
            to End the War in Vietnam. He attended many rallies and protests, and organized many 
            as well. With Tom Hayden, Davis went to a conference in Czechoslovakia and both Hayden 
            and Davis along with David Dellinger were invited by North Vietnamese leadership to escort 
            American prisoners back to the United States. In his later life, Davis became a promoter 
            of Guru Maharaj Ji, a speaker who claimed to have a great power of meditation.

        <h4 style="margin-top: 150px;">Tom Hayden</h4>
        <img src="tom-hayden.jpeg" alt="Tom Hayden" style="width:350px;margin-bottom: 80px;" class="image">
        <p>
            Tom Hayden was the founder of the Students for a Democratic Society, and his passion 
            for the anti-war movement started during his time at the University of Michigan after 
            witnessing the witch hunts of the Human Un-American Activities Committee. Hayden was 
            also a civil rights activist participating in sit-ins, voter registration drives, and 
            the Freedom Riders. Along with Davis and Dellinger, Hayden attended a conference in 
            Czechoslovakia and escorted American prisoners out of North Vietnam. He became a politician 
            later in life, winning a seat in the California senate. He wrote over 20 books and taught 
            at California Universities and Harvard.

        <h4 style="margin-top: 60px;">Jerry Rubin</h4>
        <img src="jerry-rubin.jpeg" alt="Jerry Rubin" style="width:300px;margin-bottom: 30px;margin-top: 30px;" class="image1">
        <p>
            Jerry Rubin grew up as a very talented writer and became a reporter for the Cincinnati Star 
            to support his younger brother when his parents passed away. His far left political opinion 
            started when his aunt took him to Cuba where he met Che Guevara, the Minister of Industries 
            and a notable marxist. After this, he moved to Berkeley. Rubin organized Berkeley’s Vietnam 
            Day Committee and held the world’s largest teach-in against the Vietnam War. With Abbie 
            Hoffman, Rubin founded the Youth International Party, or YIPPIES. Rubin and Hoffman’s 
            “festival of life” in Chicago is what ended them up in court. Rubin passed away in his 50s 
            after getting hit by a car in Los Angeles.

        <h4>Abbie Hoffman</h4>
        <img src="abbie-hoffman-1.jpeg" alt="Abbie Hoffman" style="width:220px;" class="image">
        <p style="margin-top: 50px;">
            Abbie Hoffman was most likely considered the most unruly of the Chicago 7. He 
            often interrupted and mocked Judge Hoffman, and was not serious when testifying. 
            Earlier in his life, he worked for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
             However, he decided to live a more flamboyant life. Hoffman was the founder of 
             the Youth International Party, or YIPPIES. He worked closely with Jerry Rubin 
             in this group. One elaborate stunt was when Hoffman and Rubin and many others 
             claimed they would “levitate the pentagon.” Hoffman was heavily involved with 
             LSD. After the trial, he published a book titled “Steal This Book.” He died due 
             to suicide after struggling with Bipolar Disorder.

        <img src="lee-weiner.jpeg" alt="Lee Weiner" style="width:300px;" class="image1">
        <p>
            Lee Weiner was one of the forgettable members of the Chicago 7, but the only one from Chicago. Weiner 
            was not part of an organization, but did protest in Chicago that day. He faced charges 
            for his attempt to teach protestors how to use potentially dangerous weapons. In an interview, 
            Weiner explained that his closest friends were Hoffman and Rubin, and they often had troubles 
            with Hayden. Weiner had troubles with Hayden later on in life too, often criticizing his 
            political decisions.

        <h4>John Froines</h4>
        <img src="john-froines.jpeg" alt="John Froines" style="width:300px;" class="image">
        <p>
            John Froines was considered a forgettable member of the Chicago 7 as he was 
            not the organizer of any larger organization. However, he was a member of the 
            Students for a Democratic Society. Froines was a chemist, receiving a masters 
            from UC Berkeley and a PhD from Yale. In his later life, he worked as a 
            Professor at UCLA.
