    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div class="body">
        <p>
            As the United States entered into war with Vietnam in the 1960s, they utilized a service which would 
            select random male American citizens, and put them in the Armed Forces. This service was called the draft. 
            Controversy came about when this strategy was put into place, with many claiming the practice was immoral and 
            uncalled for. As a matter of fact, the entire war with Vietnam was uncalled for. The war was to fight Ho Chi Minh's 
            communist forces that took hold of the north of Vietnam. The 1960s saw countless anti-war protests to 
            end the war in Vietnam.

            The Chicago Seven (or orignally the Chicago Eight) were a group of men who where charged with "conspiracy 
            to cross state lines with intent to incite a riot." All were part of organizations planning to protest in Chicago, 
            but none planned for the devestating results. The Students for a Democratic Society planned for a normal protest 
            where force was only necessary at certain moments while the YIPPIES planned for a "Festival of Life." The city of 
            Chicago dispatched thousands of police officers, and riots broke out, leaving many injured and in jail.
            The defendants, from left to right, were David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, John Froines, 
            Tom Hayden, and Lee Weiner. Their attorneys were William Kuntsler and Leanard Weinglass. The Chicago Seven did not 
            originally have only seven men. Bobby Seale is what made the Chicago Seven Eight, but he was not represented in 
            court, and was so mistreated his case was declared a mistrial and he was not tried.

        The trial started in late September of 1969, and ended in February of 1970. By the end of the trial, the defendents 
        and their attorneys were charged with 175 counts of contempt. These charges of contempt put each defendent and attorney 
        in jail from two to four years. All defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy, but all except Froines and Weiner 
        were found guilty of intent to riot and sentenced to five extra years and a fine of $5,000. However, these charges were 
        soon dropped. No defendant or attorney served time.
