    <h3>The Attorneys and Judge</h3>
    <h4>Defense</h4>

    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 15px;">Leonard Weinglass (Left) & William Kunstler (Right)</p>
    <p>
        William Kunstler acted as the defense attorney for the Chicago 7, but not for Bobby Seale. 
        He was buddy-buddy with his clients, often drinking and eating out with the seven defendants. 
        He was usually not prepared, but had a confidence that covered up this. In his high school 
        years, Kunstler was part of a gang that stole gum from vending machines and broke windows. 
        However, he ended up earning degrees from Yale University and Columbia Diversity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Leonard Weinglass was more prepared than Kunstler in court. He received his law degree from Yale. 
        He did not say much during the trial, but Judge Julius Hoffman still found a way to charge him with 
        20 months for contempt. 
    </p>
    <h4>Judge Julius Hoffman</h4>

    <p>
        Judge Julius Hoffman was the judge of the trial of the Chicago 7, and he was quite well liked by the 
        defendants. Throughout the trial, Judge Hoffman showed extreme bias towards the prosecution. Most of 
        the defendants often insulted him to his face, even Dellinger, who was considered the most positive of 
        the group. Judge Hoffman threw out counts of contempt to the defendants constantly, and often sustained 
        the prosecutor's objections even if they were not particularly valid. 
    </p>
    <h4>Prosecution</h4>

    <p>
        Thomas Foran was the chief prosecutor of the Chicago 7 trial. He was known for being straightforward and 
        extremely professional. He was close with the FBI and Robert Kennedy, often claiming he knew Kennedy 
        better than Tom Hayden, who was also friends with Kennedy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Richard Schultz was the assistant prosecutor. Although Schultz and Foran worked together, they were 
        very different. Schultz was considered “the government’s pit bull.” He was ambitious and rough.
